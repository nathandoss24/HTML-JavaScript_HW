                <p><em>The Departed</em> is an absolutely amazing thrill ride! A masterpiece filled with constant tension, twists and turns around every corner, and an all-star cast to top it off.</p>
                <p>With its two and a half hour run-time, <em>The Departed</em> is by no means a short film, however it does an excellent job of maintaining your attention, keeping you engaged and on the edge of your seat. The stage is set for the ultimate cat and mouse/spy vs. spy game, with two main characters desparately attempting to expose the other's identity before the other can completely blow up their world. The experience leaves you holding your breath as you wait in anticipation of who will come out in the end with their lives still in tact.</p>
                <p>Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon, along with their stellar side cast, put on amazing performances and really capture the vibe of what their respective characters would be like in a real world setting.</p>
                <p>This movie will definintely be on my list of all time favorites as long as I live!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The movie is a remake of the 2002 Hong King film <i>Interanl Affairs</i> and loosely based on the real-life Boston Winter Hill Gang</li>
                        <li>Leonardo DiCaprio described his character, Billy Costigan, as being under a 24-hr panick attack.</li>
                        <li>The director, Martin Scorsese, originally wanted Al Pacino to play the role of Frank Costello, but was turned down.</li>
                        <li>Mark Wahlberg easily fell back into his native accent for the movie. Scorsese joked that it was so thick, that the movie would need subtitles.</li>
